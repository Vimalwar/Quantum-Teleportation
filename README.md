# Quantum-Teleportation

We now walk through a popular quantum information technique known as Quantum Teleportation. While teleportation has been thought of as the stuff of sci-fi legend, we are going to prove that it is
actually already possible today! The technique leverages many foundational principles of quantum computing, and it has lots of useful applications across the entire field. These principles include: the
no-cloning theorem, quantum entanglement, and the principle of deferred measurement. We will be demonstrating how quantum teleportation can be quantified using Cluster States.
